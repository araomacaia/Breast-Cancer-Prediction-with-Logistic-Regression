## üìå Introduction
In this project, I applied **Logistic Regression** to the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.  
The dataset contains detailed measurements of cell nuclei, along with a diagnosis label:  
- **0 ‚Üí Benign**  
- **1 ‚Üí Malignant**

The main goal was to build and evaluate a classification model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant, based on the input features.

## üéØ Objectives
1. Understand the workflow of logistic regression in practice.  
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing:
   - Drop useless columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`).  
   - Encode target variable (`diagnosis`) into binary (0/1).  
   - Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.  
3. Train and evaluate a logistic regression model.  
4. Analyze model performance with:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC Curve & AUC Score  
   - Threshold tuning experiments  
5. Explain the role of the **sigmoid function** in logistic regression and how the decision threshold affects predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Import libraries** (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn).  
2. **Load dataset** (`df = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")`).  
3. **Explore data**: shape, summary statistics, missing values.  
4. **Visualize missingness** with a heatmap.  
5. **Clean dataset**: drop irrelevant columns, encode target.  
6. **Preprocessing**: scale numeric features with `StandardScaler`.  
7. **Split dataset** into training and test sets.  
8. **Train Logistic Regression model**.  
9. **Evaluate model**:
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1).  
   - Confusion Matrix.  
   - ROC-AUC Curve.  
10. **Threshold tuning** to study precision-recall tradeoffs.  
11. **Explain sigmoid function** and decision boundary.  

---

## üìä Results
- **Accuracy**: ~97% on the test set.  
- **ROC-AUC Score**: ~0.99.  
- Both precision and recall were very high, showing the model is well-suited for medical prediction tasks.  

Figures and reports saved in the `outputs/` folder:

- `class_distribution.png`  
- `confusion_matrix.png`  
- `roc_curve.png`  
- `summary_statistics.csv`  
- `classification_report.csv`  
- `scaled_features.csv`

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- Logistic Regression performed exceptionally well on this dataset.  
- The model achieved strong accuracy and balanced performance across precision and recall.  
- **Threshold tuning** showed how adjusting the decision rule can favor recall (catching more malignant cases) or precision (reducing false alarms), depending on the clinical context.  
- The project demonstrates the practical workflow of logistic regression, making it a solid foundation for more advanced models.
